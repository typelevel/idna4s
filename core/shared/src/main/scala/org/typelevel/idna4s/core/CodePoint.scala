/**
 * A newtype for representing a Unicode code point.
 *
 * Unicode code points are a integral values from [0, 0x10FFFF].
 *
 * This type is not (and should not) generally be used in critical path performance sensitive
 * code. It is mostly useful for generating error information, testing, and for some performance
 * insensitive methods which operate only a single code point. In particular for error messages
 * where we generally should not render arbitrary code points as they may influence the output
 * text in ways we do not anticipate, such as bidi scripts or where the code point in isolation
 * is not able to be rendered at all.
 *
 * The `toString` for this class does ''not'' render the `String` representation of this code
 * point, it renders the base 10 and base 16 value of the code point, as well as the number of
 * UTF-16 char values needed to represent this code point and if possible a prose description of
 * the code point. The reason for not rendering the `String` representation is that this type is
 * often used in error cases where the code point will have no valid `String` representation, or
 * where that representation is not meaningful, or where that representation could mangle the
 * error message (as noted above).
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * {{{
 * scala> CodePoint.fromChar('a')
 * val res0: Either[String, org.typelevel.idna4s.core.CodePoint] = Right(CodePoint(value = 97, hexValue = 0x0061, name = LATIN SMALL LETTER A, utf16CharCount = 1))
 * }}}
 *
 * @see
 *   [[https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/ Unicode Security Considerations]]
